# Course Tracker  

## ðŸš€ Overview  

Welcome to the Course Tracker! This project was created for personal use to help me monitor the remaining time for my courses, specifically focusing on my React.js coursework. I found there were no suitable applications or Chrome extensions available that met my needs, so I decided to build my own solution.  

The Course Tracker allows users to add courses with titles and total lecture counts, mark lectures as completed, and see an overview of the total time left for their courses. Its sleek interface and real-time updates make it a handy tool for anyone looking to stay organized and on top of their learning journey.

# Note: If you want to clear the information you added, you can do so by clearing the local storage... :)

## ðŸ“¦ Features  

- **Add Courses**: Easily enter the course title and the total number of lectures.  
- **Mark Completion**: Keep track of completed lectures, with visual feedback for completed courses.  
- **Local Storage**: Courses are saved in local storage, so your data is retained even after refreshing the page.  
- **Total Time Overview**: View how many lectures you've completed and how many remain.

Thanks to GhatGPT :). I reached out for help with styling because I didnâ€™t have enough time to work on the design myself.I was able to give the application a polished and appealing look without the extra time commitment.
